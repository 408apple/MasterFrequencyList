<p align="center">
<b>A spreadsheet with many common radio frequencies, ID's and other handy information</b><br>

Use this sheet to find any RF frequency or info. I hate having to surf the web every time I want to know X frequency or info so I made this to work offline, on my phone etc.  <br>

I keep a master excel file so I can refer to the common RF Frequencies, band plan etc.
It comes in handy for unknown frequencies I find when playing around with my Software Defined Radios.
I'll update the repo as I mod these in the future.

Here is the older YouTube video where I refer to the list:
